# SpriteBricks

WIP 2D game engine I work on in my spare time. Currently includes rendering and input layers, as well as some basic
functionality for loading in images (this will be expanded into a more complete image layer very soon). There's also
a relatively easy to use and performative sprite batcher included. More features are still to come. High on that list 
are file abstractions, an abstraction of the main loop, and support for TrueType fonts.
