# SpriteBricks

WIP 2D game engine that uses OpenGL 3.3 and SDL 2.0. Currently includes rendering and input layers, a basic ECS, a graphical editor that uses DearImgui and some
functionality for loading in images (via stb_image). There's also a relatively easy to use and performative sprite batcher included. More features are still to come. 
High on that list are file abstractions and support for TrueType fonts.

There's a small example program in the appSrc folder that uses the ECS and has custom editors implemented for custom components.
