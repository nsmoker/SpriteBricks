# SpriteBricks

WIP 2D game engine I work on in my spare time. Uses OpenGL 3.3 and SDL 2.0. Currently includes rendering and input layers, as well as some basic
functionality for loading in images (this will be expanded into a more complete image layer very soon). There's also
a relatively easy to use and performative sprite batcher included. More features are still to come. High on that list 
are file abstractions, an entity component system, and support for TrueType fonts.

There's a small example program in the appSrc folder, though if you really are seeking to use this, I warn you: this code is almost certainly going to change radically as I add more functionality.
